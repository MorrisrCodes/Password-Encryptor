# Password Encryptor
## Description
This Python project serves as a demonstration of fundamental coding skills, focusing on cybersecurity principles such as password strength and encryption, as well as core coding concepts like GUI development and exception handling.

## Features
Password Strength: The project illustrates how password length should have a minimum length to increase security and staying compliant with Cyber Security Standards.
Encryption: It showcases encryption techniques that maintain the size of encrypted data regardless of the password length, highlighting the essential aspect of data security in transit and storage.

## Usage
Once the project is installed, you can launch the application and fill in the entry fields to encrypt a password and view the result, even decrypt the passwords.

## Cybersecurity Principles Demonstrated
- Password Strength: Demonstrates how longer passwords contribute significantly to stronger security measures.
- Encryption: Uses encryption techniques that maintain data size to ensure secure data transmission and storage.
- Exception Handling: Implements robust error handling strategies to enhance the application's reliability and user experience.

## Coding Fundamentals
- Python Basics: Utilizes fundamental Python concepts such as loops, functions, and classes to build the application.
- GUI Development: Developed using Python's GUI libraries to create an intuitive user interface.
- Exception Handling: Illustrates effective use of exception handling to manage errors and edge cases gracefully.
